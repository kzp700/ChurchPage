About:
This is a church website that I have created as a portfolio project, and as a volunteer job, for a small church in my community. Images are courtey of Unspash.com (https://unsplash.com/license). The webpage was built using Bootstrap 4 and EJS and is live on Heroku at "http://churchpage.herokuapp.com/."

Details:
This website has been created, by me, for Cameron Creek Church of Farmersville, CA. At the request of the church, this website has been designed to be mostly static and as maintence free as possible. The only dynamic section of the site is on the "messages" page, where the Facebook page plugin is used to deliver the church's Facebook feed automatically. 

Dependencies:
This website was written for Node.js and uses these dependencies:
Express
Body-parser
EJS
Bootstrap 4
