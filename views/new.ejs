    <p class="p-standard pl-xl-4 px-lg-4 pl-md-3 pl-sm-2 pl-2 pb-2">Expect to be treated with love and respect. Expect simplicity and honesty. The highest commandment is to love your neighbor and we take that to heart. Everyeone is welcome, and we mean everyone. We aren't into titles, formalties, and ceremonies. You'll be greeted with at least a handshake and probably a hug. Sit where you want. Dress how you're comfortable. We don't have a dress code and that is on purpose. What matters most to us is that you celebrate the love of God with us. We welcome those who have it together, and those who struggle. Eveyone has a place here.</p>

<p class="p-standard pl-xl-4 px-lg-4 pl-md-3 pl-sm-2 pl-2 pb-2">We're a family founded on the love of Jesus Christ. We believe the love of Jesus Christ covers all sins and makes all believers one family, bound together through our Savior. We believe that no sin is unforgivable and no one is irredeemable. We don't believe in titles, formalities, or ceremonies; but choose to focus on a close relationship with Jesus based upon what the Bible reveals to us about Him.</p>

<p class="p-standard pl-xl-4 px-lg-4 pl-md-3 pl-sm-2 pl-2 pb-2">Jesus told everyone to come to Him as they are, and that is the core philosophy of our church. You don't have to fix yourself before coming to church, just come. You don't need to dress up, just come. You don't need to change the way you talk, the way you act, who your friends are, or anything else. Just come as you are, right now. Jesus accepts all who seek him and he is waiting for you.</p>
