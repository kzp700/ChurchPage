    <p class="p-standard pl-xl-4 px-lg-4 pl-md-3 pl-sm-2 pl-2 pb-2">We're a family modeled after the love of Jesus Christ. We believe the love of Jesus Christ covers all sin and makes all believers one family, bound together through our Savior. We believe that no sin is unforgivable and no one is irredeemable. We don't believe in titles, formalities, or ceremonies; but choose to focus on a close relationship with Jesus based upon what the Bible reveals to us about Him.</p>

    <p class="p-standard pl-xl-4 px-lg-4 pl-md-3 pl-sm-2 pl-2 pb-2">Jesus told everyone to come as they are and that is the core philosophy of our church. You don't have to fix yourself before coming to church, just come. You don't need to dress up, just come. You don't need to change the way you talk, the way you act, who your friends are, or anything else. Just come as you are, right now. Jesus accepts all who seek him and he is waiting for you.</p>
